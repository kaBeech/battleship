# Battleship

This is a simple web-based game of Battleship. I made it during a test drive of
[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and
[Avante](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim). The test drive went better
than I expected, so I decided to keep the game and show it off here! The whole
thing only took a couple hours to build.
